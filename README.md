# Project 1: Build Your Personal Website with AI!
In this project, you will leverage AI and your knowledge of HTML and CSS to build a simple, single-page personal website that will showcase your projects.

You will use AI to help you brainstorm design ideas, apply web development best practices, and troubleshoot issues, bringing your vision to life on screen! 

Launch a Codespace to get started. **Remember to Commit and Push** your project changes to GitHub from Codespaces to prevent losing progress.

## Deployment
To make your website live on GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository settings.
2. Scroll to "Pages" in the left sidebar.
3. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
4. Choose branch "main" and folder "/ (root)".
5. Click "Save".
Your site will be available at: https://gca-classroom.github.io/01-prj-personal-site/

## Reflections
- **Building Websites with AI**: Using AI like GitHub Copilot helped me learn HTML and CSS faster by suggesting code snippets and explaining concepts. It made the process more efficient, but I still had to understand the basics to make sure everything worked correctly.
- **Interview Question**: If I were interviewing for a web development role, a question I might ask is: 'What technologies does your team use for version control and collaboration?' This would help me understand the workflow and if it aligns with my skills.
- **LinkedIn Post**: Excited to share my first portfolio website! Built with HTML and CSS, featuring sections on my bio and skills. Learned a lot about responsive design and using AI tools for coding. Check it out: https://gca-classroom.github.io/01-prj-personal-site/ #WebDevelopment #Portfolio #HTML #CSS
